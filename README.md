# Example of Tour Trip Website 

LIVE DEMO ; https://grand-valkyrie-5acd85.netlify.app/

I develop simple example of tour trip website's main page.

Page has 3 parts which is "Reviews", "Tours", "Questions and Answers"

The informations in Ouestion is from dataquestion.js
The informations in Data part is from data.js

For tour's info, I used this API "https://course-api.com/react-tours-project"
